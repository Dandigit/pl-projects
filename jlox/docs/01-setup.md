# Setting up Lox
So you want to try Lox out? Well, first, you've got to...

## Get the source code
You can grab it from GitHub with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dandigit/pl-projects.git
```
Or, alternatively, download and extract [the zip](http://todo.com). Next...

## Compile jlox
From the root directory of the repository, navigate to the jlox directory. I've written a little script to compile jlox for you - just run:
```
./build
```
Now, on to the final step...

## Running jlox
You should now have a working `./jlox` script in the pl-projects/jlox directory. Fire up the REPL with `./jlox` or run a file with `./jlox file-name`.
