# Data
Data in Lox can be evaluated in expressions or functions, stored in variables and grouped in classes. First, let's go over the primitive data types.

## Data types
Lox is a dynamically typed language, meaning that the same variable can represent any type. The built in data types in Lox are as follows:
 - `num`: A double-precision number, e.g. `42`, `4.2`
 - `bool`: True or false (or truthy/falsey), e.g. `false`, `2 == 2.0`
 - `str`: An ASCII string. Literals are wrapped in `"` quotes, e.g `"Hello, world!"`
