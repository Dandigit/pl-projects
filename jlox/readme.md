# jlox
`jlox` is an **enhanced** implementation of Lox, written in Java.

## Notable additions
Along with the code in Crafting Interpreters, I've implemented:
- Arrays
- References
- Modules and imports
- Standard library
- Implicit semicolons
- Multi-line comments (they can nest!)
- Comma operator
- Ternary (conditional) operator
- Static class methods (metaclass)
- Getter methods
- `print` as a foreign function
- Other foreign functions like `put()` and `getln()`
- Lambda syntax

## Get started
Want to get started writing Lox? There's some documentation to introduce you to the language [here](./docs/00-contents.md).
